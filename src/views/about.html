            Jieun Kim, based in Eindhoven, works with discarded paper as a structural medium, building it into volume rather than surface.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Through processes of recombination and alteration, the material is brought into new conditions. Its density, structure, and surface shift according to how it is handled and what it encounters.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Released from its assigned role, the material is reorganized into forms that stand on their own.<br>
