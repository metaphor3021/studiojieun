                  Inspired by the traditional Korean Jangdok, fermentation jars once made from pure clay, this work reflects both the functionality and enduring presence of these vessels. Soft and workable in their raw state, Jangdok allow air to pass through, preserve contents, and prevent decay, qualities that continue to inspire the way I approach fragile materials.    <br>
     <br>
In Held Shape, everyday materials such as egg cartons and eggshells are hand-shaped into a durable form. The slow process of layering and drying follows a natural pace, steady, patient, and guided by touch. The work holds a quiet tension between softness and strength, allowing ordinary matter to reveal its hidden potential and inviting the viewer to imagine how it might continue to change over time.
